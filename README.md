Additionally, an interactive Shiny app is included for dynamic visualization and user interaction.  

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- Predictive modeling with machine learning techniques  
- Interactive Shiny app for exploring results  
- Comprehensive analysis report available as an HTML document  

## Files Included
- `Diabeti_Sami_Hoxha.html` â€” exported R Markdown report in HTML format  
- Shiny app scripts for interactive exploration  

## How to View
1. Open the `Diabeti_Sami_Hoxha.html` file in any web browser to see the full analysis report.  
2. Run the Shiny app scripts in RStudio to interact with the predictive models and visualizations.
